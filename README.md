This project titled **"Advanced Statistical Model Analysis on Kenyan Women Empowerment Indicators"** involves multivariate regression analysis on nine measurements of women empowerment in Kenya obtained from the WorldBank. 

It is general knowledge that the overall health and empowerment of women can have various connections with the overall climate and social progression within different communities and regions. In this study, these various connections are examined through a series of advanced statistical models with special emphasis on **Multivariate Regression Analysis**, which is used to measure the relationship between several quantitative response variables, as well as multiple predictors. Other techniques included in this study are **Time Series, Multiple Regression, The Genetic Algorithm for model selection, and the Bayesian MCMH approach.** These methods will be applied to explore the relationships between **9 women empowerment indicators** and **37 measurements of different aspects of Kenyan society.** **Time in years** will also be considered to account for the time series component, resulting in **38 total predictors.** To reduce multi-collinearity within the predictors of the data set 5 different models through a subset of the predictors in categories of economics, politics, health, education, and technology.
